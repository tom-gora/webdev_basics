## My WebDev Journey

Kind of a diary. Small size project collection inspired by icodethis.com. Some pages, apps, components an widgets that I am building as I challenged myself to make up for the shortcomings of my college education. I was not happy that they instant-dropped me in Bootstrap and jQuery completely skipping over fundamentals. These are some basic projects that I build as I catch up on vanilla JS and CSS.
